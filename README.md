# Refactoring an expression tree

We have provided a fairly naive implementation of an expression tree for basic arithmetic in JavaScript.

Apply your knowledge of good software design principles to refactor and improve the design of this code.
Feel free to change anything in the file as part of your refactoring, apart from the final assertions 
that consume the tree.
